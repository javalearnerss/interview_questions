Is final class always immutable?

Is final variable always immutable?

🔹 Designing Immutable Class Questions

Steps to create immutable class?

Why class should be final for immutability?

Why fields should be private and final?

Why no setters in immutable class?

Why defensive copy is required?

How to handle mutable fields (Date, List, Map)?

How do you ensure immutability in inheritance?

🔹 Intermediate Questions

What is defensive copying?

Deep copy vs defensive copy difference?

How immutability improves caching?

How immutability improves security?

How immutability helps in HashMap keys?

How immutability helps in safe publishing?

Can immutable object be lazily initialized?

What is value object concept?

🔹 Advanced / Senior Level Questions

How JVM optimizes immutable objects?

How immutability helps in lock-free programming?

How immutability helps in functional programming?

Tradeoffs of immutability (memory vs safety)?

How to design high performance immutable objects?

Immutability vs copy-on-write collections?

How record classes (Java 16+) support immutability?

How immutability works in distributed systems?

🔹 Scenario-Based Questions (Very Important)

👉 You have immutable class with List field — how will you protect it?

👉 Immutable class but contains Date field — what will you do?

👉 Can immutable object be partially initialized?

👉 How do you update immutable object values?

👉 Immutable object in cache — benefits?

👉 How do you design thread-safe configuration object?

🔹 Tricky / Trap Questions

⚡ Is String fully immutable?
👉 Yes (from external modification perspective)

⚡ Is immutability same as read-only?
👉 No (read-only view may still reflect changes)

⚡ Can immutable class have mutable collections?
👉 Yes, but must return defensive copies

⚡ Is enum immutable?
👉 Yes

⚡ Can immutable object be serialized safely?
👉 Yes (usually safest)

🔹 Coding Questions (Common in Interviews)

Write custom immutable class.

Immutable class with mutable collection field.

Immutable class with Date field.

Convert mutable class to immutable.
