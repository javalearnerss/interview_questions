Java Serialization Interview Questions
🔹 Basic Serialization Questions

What is Serialization in Java?

What is Deserialization?

Which interface is used for Serialization?

What is Serializable marker interface?

What happens if a class does not implement Serializable?

What are ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream?

What is serialVersionUID? Why is it important?

How JVM generates serialVersionUID automatically?

What is default serialization?

Can static variables be serialized?

🔹 Intermediate Level Questions

What is transient keyword?

Can final variables be serialized?

Can constructors run during deserialization?

How do you make a class partially serializable?

What happens if superclass is not serializable?

How to prevent serialization of some fields?

What is Externalizable interface?

Difference between Serializable and Externalizable?

What is custom serialization?

What are writeObject() and readObject() methods?

🔹 Advanced Serialization Questions (Senior Level)

How does serialization work internally in JVM?

What is object graph in serialization?

How circular references are handled in serialization?

What is serialization proxy pattern?

How do you secure serialized objects?

What are serialization vulnerabilities?

How do you avoid deserialization attacks?

How serialization impacts performance?

When NOT to use Java serialization?

How do frameworks avoid Java native serialization?

🔹 Scenario-Based Questions (Very Important)

👉 You changed class structure after serialization — what happens?

👉 You added new field in class — will old serialized object work?

👉 serialVersionUID mismatch — what error comes?

👉 How do you serialize Singleton class properly?

👉 How do you serialize immutable objects?

👉 Can you serialize Lambda expressions?

🔹 Tricky / Trap Questions

⚡ Is String serialized?
👉 Yes, because String implements Serializable

⚡ Can we serialize Thread class?
👉 No (not safely / not meaningful)

⚡ Is Array serialized?
👉 Yes, if element types are serializable

⚡ Can we serialize enum?
👉 Yes (special handling by JVM)

🔹 Coding-Based Serialization Questions

Write code to serialize and deserialize object.

Custom serialization using writeObject/readObject.

Serialize object to file and read back.

Serialize object over network socket.

🔹 Real Production Discussion Questions

✔ Why many companies avoid Java native serialization?
✔ Why JSON / Protobuf preferred over serialization?
✔ Serialization performance vs memory tradeoff
✔ Backward compatibility handling

⭐ Must Prepare Topics (If Short on Time)

If interview is near, focus on:
✅ serialVersionUID
✅ transient keyword
✅ Serializable vs Externalizable
✅ Custom serialization
✅ Serialization proxy pattern
✅ Security issues (Deserialization attack)
