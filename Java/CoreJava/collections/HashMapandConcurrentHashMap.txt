✅ Scenario-Based Questions (Very Important for Senior Roles)

👉 When would you choose ConcurrentHashMap over synchronized HashMap?

👉 High read, low write system — which map will you use?

👉 Cache design — HashMap or ConcurrentHashMap?

👉 Multiple threads updating same key — what happens?

👉 How do you design lock-free cache using ConcurrentHashMap?

👉 How do you avoid contention in ConcurrentHashMap?

✅ Tricky / Trap Questions

⚡ Why ConcurrentHashMap does not allow null key/value?
👉 To avoid ambiguity during concurrent reads

⚡ Is ConcurrentHashMap 100% lock free?
👉 No (uses CAS + synchronized blocks when needed)

⚡ Is size() always accurate in ConcurrentHashMap?
👉 Not guaranteed during concurrent updates

⚡ Does ConcurrentHashMap use Red-Black tree like HashMap?
👉 Yes (Java 8+)

✅ Coding Questions (Common)
