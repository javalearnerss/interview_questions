Cloneable Interview Questions in Java
🔹 Basic Cloneable Questions

What is cloning in Java?

What is Cloneable interface?

Is Cloneable a marker interface?

What happens if you call clone() without implementing Cloneable?

Which class provides clone() method?

What is Object.clone() method signature?

Difference between cloning and copy constructor?

Is cloning shallow copy or deep copy by default?

Why clone() method is protected in Object class?

How do you make clone() public?

🔹 Intermediate Level Questions

What is shallow copy?

What is deep copy?

How do you implement deep copy manually?

What happens if object has reference fields?

How arrays behave in cloning?

Can immutable objects be cloned?

What exceptions clone() throws?

Why Cloneable interface does not have clone() method?

How to clone collections?

Can we override clone()?

🔹 Advanced / Senior Level Questions

Why Cloneable is considered broken design by many developers?

Problems with Cloneable interface design.

Why copy constructors or builders are preferred today?

How cloning impacts performance?

How cloning behaves in inheritance hierarchy?

How to clone object with final fields?

How to prevent cloning of object?

How Singleton class prevents cloning?

How to implement thread-safe cloning?

When should you avoid cloning completely?

🔹 Scenario-Based Questions (Important)

👉 Class contains List of objects — how will you deep clone?

👉 If parent class is Cloneable but child is not — what happens?

👉 If child class is Cloneable but parent is not — what happens?

👉 How do you clone object graph?

👉 If object contains DB connection — should you clone?

🔹 Tricky / Trap Questions

⚡ Does Cloneable have methods?
👉 No — marker interface

⚡ Does clone() call constructor?
👉 No

⚡ Can we clone String?
👉 Not needed (immutable)

⚡ Can we clone enum?
👉 No (not allowed)

⚡ Is clone faster than new object creation?
👉 Not always — depends on implementation

🔹 Coding Questions (Very Common)
1️⃣ Basic Clone Example

Implement clone for simple class

2️⃣ Deep Copy Example

Clone object with nested objects

3️⃣ Prevent Cloning

Throw CloneNotSupportedException

4️⃣ Clone Singleton Safely

Return same instance

🔹 Real Interview Discussion Points
