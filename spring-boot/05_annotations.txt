⭐ Ultra-Senior Annotation Questions
🔥 Proxy Mechanism Questions

Which annotations depend on AOP proxy?

@Transactional

@Async

@Cacheable

@Retryable

🔥 Ordering Questions

What loads first?

Environment

Config files

Auto configuration

User beans


1) Why does @Transactional not work when you call the method from the same class?

What’s “self-invocation”?

How do Spring proxies apply transactions?

2) @Transactional on a private / final method—will it work?

Why/why not?

What about final classes?

3) @Transactional doesn’t roll back—why?

Checked vs unchecked exceptions

rollbackFor / noRollbackFor

Catching exception and not rethrowing

4) @Async “works” but still blocks the request—what happened?

Self-invocation again

Wrong executor (sync fallback)

Calling .get() on Future/CompletableFuture

5) @Async + @Transactional together—what’s the trap?

Transaction context doesn’t propagate across threads

What is actually transactional: caller or async method?

6) @Scheduled runs in parallel unexpectedly—why?

Default scheduler vs custom scheduler

Multiple instances/pods (Kubernetes) → job runs N times

7) How do you prevent @Scheduled from running concurrently across pods?

Distributed lock patterns (ShedLock etc.)

Leader election / single-runner deployment

8) Why does @Cacheable not cache at all?

Same-class call (proxy not used)

Key generation mismatch

Cache manager not configured / wrong cache name

9) @Cacheable caches “wrong” results—what’s the common cause?

Missing key → same key for all calls

Mutable keys / arrays

Caching null vs not caching null

10) @Configuration vs @Component for config classes—what breaks?

@Configuration uses CGLIB proxying

Without it, @Bean method calls create new instances

11) @Bean method calling another @Bean method—why does it sometimes create 2 objects?

Happens when class isn’t proxied (@Configuration missing or proxyBeanMethods disabled)

12) @SpringBootApplication scanning issue: why aren’t beans detected?

Component scan starts from the package of the main class

Main class placed in wrong package

13) @Profile confusion: why is a bean created even when profile isn’t active?

Where @Profile is applied (class vs method)

Default profiles / profile groups

14) @Value injects null or fails—why?

Property not loaded

Wrong property key

Using it too early (static fields / before environment)

Prefer @ConfigurationProperties

15) @ConfigurationProperties binds nothing—most common reasons?

Missing @EnableConfigurationProperties / not registered as bean

Wrong prefix

Missing setters / constructor binding mismatch

Using records without proper setup

16) @ConditionalOnProperty behaves opposite of what you expect—how?

matchIfMissing=true

Property exists but empty vs missing

Relaxed binding names (my.prop vs MY_PROP)

17) @Primary + @Qualifier together—who wins?

@Qualifier wins (it’s explicit)

Where @Primary helps: ambiguous injection without qualifiers

18) @Autowired with multiple constructors—what happens?

Modern Spring prefers single constructor, autowires it implicitly

If multiple constructors exist: ambiguity unless @Autowired marks one

19) @Order doesn’t seem to affect your filters/interceptors—why?

@Order affects some types (e.g., FilterRegistrationBean, Ordered)

Security filter chain ordering has its own rules

20) @ControllerAdvice not catching exceptions—why?

Exception thrown before controller (filter/security)

Response already committed

Wrong exception type / handler method signature mismatch

Story 1 — Transaction Didn’t Roll Back (Money Lost)
🧨 Production Incident

Payment deducted. Booking failed. No rollback.

🔍 Root Cause

@Transactional method caught exception and didn’t rethrow.

@Transactional
public void createBooking() {
   try {
      paymentService.pay();
      bookingRepo.save();
   } catch(Exception e) {
      log.error("failed", e);
   }
}

🎯 Interview Questions

Why transaction didn’t rollback?

How does Spring decide rollback?

How to fix?

✅ Expected Answer

Spring rolls back only on unchecked exceptions by default

Exception swallowed → transaction commits

Fix → rethrow or use rollbackFor

🚨 Story 2 — @Async Didn’t Run Async (System Slow)
🧨 Production Incident

Email sending blocking API response.

🔍 Root Cause

Self-invocation.

public void createBooking() {
   sendEmailAsync(); // ❌ same class call
}

@Async
public void sendEmailAsync() {}

🎯 Interview Questions

Why async didn’t work?

How does proxy work?

Fix?

✅ Expected

Proxy not used in internal call

Move async method to another bean

🚨 Story 3 — Cache Not Working (DB Overloaded)
🧨 Incident

Cache annotation present but DB still hit every time.

@Cacheable("users")
public User getUser(String id) {}

🔍 Root Cause

Method called internally OR cache key issue.

🎯 Questions

When cache won’t work?

How key generated?

How to debug cache?

🚨 Story 4 — Scheduled Job Ran 6 Times (Data Corruption)
🧨 Incident

Cron job executed once per pod in Kubernetes.

🎯 Questions

Why did it run multiple times?

How to make singleton execution?

✅ Expected

@Scheduled runs per instance

Use distributed lock / leader election

🚨 Story 5 — Two Beans Created Instead of One
🧨 Incident

Connection pool created twice → DB exhaustion.

@Component
public class AppConfig {

   @Bean
   public DataSource ds() { return new HikariDataSource(); }

   @Bean
   public Service service() { return new Service(ds()); } // ❌
}

🎯 Questions

Why two instances?

Difference if using @Configuration?

✅ Expected

No CGLIB proxy → direct method call → new instance

🚨 Story 6 — Transaction Ignored (Self Invocation)
🧨 Incident

Audit record saved even when main transaction failed.

@Transactional
public void main() {
   saveAudit(); // ❌
}

@Transactional
public void saveAudit() {}

🎯 Questions

Why second transaction not applied?

🚨 Story 7 — @Value Null in Production Only
🧨 Incident

Local works, prod fails.

Root Causes

Env variable naming mismatch

Property not loaded

Early bean initialization

🚨 Story 8 — @ConfigurationProperties Not Binding
🧨 Incident

Config values always default.

🎯 Questions

Why binding may fail?

Difference vs @Value?

🚨 Story 9 — Security Annotation Ignored
🧨 Incident

@PreAuthorize not enforced.

Root Cause

Method called internally OR security not enabled.

🚨 Story 10 — @ConditionalOnProperty Wrong Behavior
🧨 Incident

Feature disabled but bean still created.

Root Cause

matchIfMissing=true

🚨 Story 11 — Multiple Bean Injection Crash
🧨 Incident

NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException

🎯 Questions

When to use @Primary vs @Qualifier?

🚨 Story 12 — @Lazy Caused Runtime Failure
🧨 Incident

Bean initialized late → config missing → crash later.

🚨 Story 13 — @Profile Wrong Bean Loaded
🧨 Incident

Dev DB used in production.

🚨 Story 14 — @ControllerAdvice Not Catching Exceptions
Root Cause

Exception thrown in filter OR response committed.

🚨 Story 15 — @RestController Returning HTML
Root Cause

Content negotiation / Accept header mismatch.

🚨 Story 16 — @RequestBody Deserialization Failure
Root Causes

Missing default constructor

Jackson config mismatch

🚨 Story 17 — @Transactional(readOnly=true) Still Writing
Root Cause

Some DBs ignore read-only flag.

🚨 Story 18 — @EnableAsync Missing
Root Cause

Async silently runs sync.

🚨 Story 19 — @Order Not Working
Root Cause

Not all components respect @Order.

🚨 Story 20 — Annotation Works Locally But Not In Prod
Root Causes

Proxy disabled

Different bean lifecycle

Missing config class scanning
