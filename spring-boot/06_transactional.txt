1. Self Invocation Problem
    Q: Why does @Transactional not work when one method calls another method inside the same class?
    Expected Insight : Spring uses proxy-based AOP, Internal method call → bypasses proxy → no transaction
    How to fix?

    Q: If you call an @Async method from a @Transactional method, does transaction propagate?

5. ReadOnly Transaction Reality Check
    Q: What does @Transactional(readOnly = true) actually do?

6. Nested Transaction Confusion
    Q: Difference between: REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, NESTED

    Q: Should you call external payment API inside DB transaction?

8. Transaction Not Working on Interface Default Method
    Q: Why sometimes @Transactional works on interface but not always?

9. Multiple Transaction Managers
    Q: What happens if you have 2 datasources?

10. LazyInitializationException Despite Transaction
    Q: Why LazyInitializationException occurs even inside transaction sometimes?

11. Transaction Boundary in Controller
    Q: Should you put @Transactional on Controller?

12. Transaction Timeout Production Scenario
    Q: What happens if transaction timeout occurs?

    Q: Why do you see:

15. Transaction Propagation Interview Killer



Top 10 Production Failure Stories Caused by Wrong @Transactional Usage
1. Self Invocation → Transactions Silently Not Applied

2. Transaction + External API Call = Database Lock Explosion

3. Checked Exception → No Rollback → Silent Data Corruption

4. @Async + @Transactional → Lost Transaction Context

5. Transaction Too Large → Connection Pool Starvation
Transaction wrapped: DB updates, Kafka publish, Cache update, Audit logging, Email sending

6. Wrong Propagation → Parent Transaction Marked Rollback

7. readOnly = true Misunderstood → Data Updated But Not Flushed

8. Missing Isolation Level → Double Booking Bug

9. Transaction Around Batch Processing → Massive Rollback

10. DB Transaction + Kafka Publish Without Outbox → Data Drift
