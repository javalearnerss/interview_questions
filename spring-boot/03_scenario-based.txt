Application Startup & Failures

A Spring Boot service suddenly takes 3× longer to start after a release. How do you diagnose and fix it?

Your application fails to start in production but works locally. What steps do you take?

After adding a new dependency, unexpected beans start getting created. How do you find the root cause?

A minor config change causes the app to fail at startup. How do you prevent such failures?

Your service crashes on startup due to missing environment variables. How do you design around this?

Configuration & Environment Management

One environment works, another breaks with the same build. How do you debug it?

Secrets were accidentally committed in application.yml. What immediate and long-term steps do you take?

Config values need to change without restarting the service. How do you design this?

A config value has different meanings across teams. How do you standardize it?

A wrong profile was activated in production. How do you detect and prevent this?

REST API & Contract Scenarios

A downstream client breaks after your API change. What went wrong and how do you fix it?

You need to introduce a new mandatory field in an existing API. How do you do it safely?

APIs start returning inconsistent error responses across services. How do you fix this?

One endpoint is abused by clients causing high CPU usage. How do you protect it?

A large response payload causes latency spikes. How do you optimize it?

Exception Handling & Resilience

An external dependency starts timing out intermittently. How does your service behave?

Retries are causing system-wide slowdown. How do you redesign retry logic?

Circuit breakers are open too often. How do you tune them?

Errors are swallowed and logs show nothing useful. How do you redesign error handling?

How do you ensure failures are visible but not catastrophic?

Database & Transactions

A simple read API starts timing out under load. What do you investigate first?

A transaction rollback does not happen as expected. How do you debug it?

N+1 queries appear after a small code change. How do you detect and prevent this?

Database connections are exhausted during peak hours. How do you fix it?

A long-running transaction blocks other requests. How do you redesign it?

Data Consistency & Distributed Systems

A service writes to DB but fails before publishing an event. How do you ensure consistency?

Duplicate events are being processed. How do you make consumers idempotent?

Two services disagree on data state. How do you debug and fix it?

Schema changes break consumers. How do you avoid this?

A replay of events corrupts downstream data. How do you design safe reprocessing?

Security Incidents

A public endpoint was unintentionally exposed. How do you respond?

JWT tokens suddenly start failing validation. How do you debug it?

Actuator endpoints are accessible publicly. How do you secure them quickly?

Role-based access behaves differently across environments. What do you check?

A vulnerability is reported in a Spring dependency. How do you handle it?

Performance & Scalability

CPU usage spikes with no increase in traffic. How do you investigate?

Thread pool queues grow indefinitely. How do you introduce backpressure?

A blocking call sneaks into a high-throughput API. How do you detect it?

After scaling pods, performance gets worse. Why could that happen?

GC pauses increase after a feature release. How do you diagnose it?

Observability & Production Debugging

Requests are slow but logs show no errors. What do you check?

Metrics look normal but users report failures. How do you reconcile this?

You cannot reproduce a production issue locally. How do you debug it?

Logs are too noisy to find real issues. How do you fix logging strategy?

Traces show latency gaps. How do you identify the bottleneck?

Kubernetes & Cloud (Spring Boot on EKS)

Pods restart frequently with no clear errors. How do you debug?

Liveness probes are killing healthy pods. How do you fix probe design?

ConfigMaps were updated but pods didn’t reflect changes. Why?

Traffic spikes after deployment cause failures. How do you handle this?

Rolling deployments cause partial outages. How do you fix rollout strategy?

Testing & Release Management

A bug reaches production despite tests passing. What went wrong?

Integration tests are too slow for CI. How do you optimize them?

A feature works in staging but not production. How do you design better tests?

A rollback is required immediately after deployment. How do you design for it?

Canary deployment shows mixed results. How do you decide to proceed?

Leadership & Decision-Making Scenarios

Two teams use Spring Boot very differently. How do you bring consistency?

A developer wants to bypass Spring Boot conventions. Do you allow it?

Business wants faster delivery at the cost of tech debt. How do you respond?

A critical incident happens at 2 AM. What’s your role as a lead?

What is the most serious Spring Boot production failure you’ve handled and what did you change afterward?
