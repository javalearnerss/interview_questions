Core Fundamentals
1️. What problem does Kubernetes solve?
Answer: Container orchestration — automated deployment, scaling, service discovery, self-healing, and resource management for containerized workloads.

2️. Explain Kubernetes architecture.
Answer: 
Control Plane:
API Server → entry point
etcd → cluster state storage
Scheduler → assigns pods to nodes
Controller Manager → maintains desired state

Node:
Kubelet → manages pods
Container runtime → runs containers
Kube-proxy → networking rules

3️. What happens when you run kubectl apply?
Answer Flow: kubectl → API Server → validates → stores desired state in etcd → controllers detect change → scheduler assigns node → kubelet creates container.

4️. Pod vs Container?
Answer:
Pod = smallest deployable unit.
Can contain multiple containers sharing network + storage.

5️. Deployment vs ReplicaSet?
Answer: Deployment manages ReplicaSet → adds rollout, rollback, updates.
ReplicaSet only ensures pod count.

6️. StatefulSet vs Deployment?
Answer: StatefulSet = stable identity + ordered startup + persistent storage.
Used for DB, Kafka, Zookeeper.

7️. DaemonSet Use Case?
Answer: Runs one pod per node.
Example: logging agents, monitoring agents.

8️. Job vs CronJob?
Answer: Job = run once.
CronJob = scheduled execution.


9️. How Kubernetes networking works?
Answer: Every pod gets IP.
Pods communicate directly (flat network).
Services provide stable virtual IP.

10. Service Types?
Answer:
ClusterIP → internal
NodePort → node exposed
LoadBalancer → cloud LB
Ingress → HTTP routing layer

11. What is CNI?
Answer:
Container Network Interface plugin managing pod networking.
Examples: Calico, Cilium, Flannel.

1️2. How DNS works inside cluster?
Answer:
CoreDNS maps service name → ClusterIP.

13. Requests vs Limits?
Answer:
Request → scheduler decision.
Limit → max allowed usage.
Memory limit breach → OOMKill.

14. QoS Classes?
Answer:
Guaranteed → best priority
Burstable → medium
BestEffort → lowest priority

15. HPA vs VPA vs Cluster Autoscaler?
Answer:
HPA → scale pods
VPA → adjust pod resources
Cluster Autoscaler → scale nodes

16. How HPA gets metrics?
Answer:
Metrics Server → CPU/memory
Prometheus adapter → custom metrics

17. ConfigMap vs Secret?
Answer:
ConfigMap → non-sensitive
Secret → base64 encoded sensitive data

18. PV vs PVC?
Answer:
PV = actual storage
PVC = request for storage

19. StorageClass?
Answer:
Defines dynamic storage provisioning policy.

20. How controllers maintain desired state?
Answer:
Watch API → detect drift → reconcile → update actual state.

21. What happens if etcd quorum lost?
Answer:
Cluster becomes read-only / unavailable.
Need quorum restore or snapshot recovery.

22. Scheduler decision factors?
Answer:
Resources
Affinity rules
Taints/Tolerations
Node selectors
Scoring plugins

23. Taints vs Tolerations?
Answer:
Taint → repels pods
Toleration → allows scheduling on tainted node

24. Pod stuck in Pending?
Answer Check:
Resources
Taints
PVC binding
Affinity rules
Scheduler logs

25. CrashLoopBackOff?
Answer Check:
App crash
OOMKilled
Probe failure
Bad config
Dependency failure

26. Node NotReady?
Answer Check:
Kubelet
Disk pressure
Network plugin
Runtime
Resource exhaustion

27. RBAC Role vs ClusterRole?
Answer:
Role → namespace scope
ClusterRole → cluster scope

28. Service Account Use?
Answer:
Pod identity to access API securely.

29. How to achieve zero downtime deployment?
Answer:
Rolling update
Readiness probes
Pod disruption budget
Graceful shutdown handling

30. How Kubernetes handles node failure?
Answer:
Node marked NotReady → pods rescheduled → services updated → traffic rerouted.
