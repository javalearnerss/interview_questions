Spring Boot in Kubernetes - Interview Questions by Seniority Level
🟢 Level 1 — Expected Knowledge (You must know)
App Deployment & Runtime
How do you deploy a Spring Boot app in Kubernetes?
What is the role of Deployment vs Pod vs ReplicaSet?
How do you externalize configuration in Kubernetes for Java apps?
How do you pass DB credentials securely to a Spring Boot app?
How do you handle different configs for dev / stage / prod?
👉 Expected Concepts: ConfigMap, Secret, env variables, volume mount configs

Health Checks (Very Important for Java)
What's the difference between: Liveness probe, Readiness probe, Startup probe?
How would you map Spring Boot Actuator endpoints to probes?
Example expectation: /actuator/health/liveness, /actuator/health/readiness

Logging & Debugging
How do you check logs of a running Pod?
How do you check previous crash logs?
How do you debug CrashLoopBackOff?

🟡 Level 2 — Strong 6-Year Developer Level
Scaling & Performance
How does HPA scale your Java application? What metrics are usually used?
Why do Java apps sometimes scale poorly in Kubernetes?
How do you tune JVM for containers?
👉 Expected:
Heap sizing vs container memory limit
GC tuning
Startup time impact

Stateless Design (Very Common Question)
Why should apps be stateless in Kubernetes?
How do you manage user sessions?
Expected Answers: Redis, DB-backed session, JWT tokens

Service Communication
How do services talk to each other inside cluster?
What is service discovery in Kubernetes?
How does DNS work inside cluster?

🟠 Level 3 — Senior Developer / Production Ownership
Deployment Strategies
Rolling update vs Blue-Green vs Canary — when to use?
How do you prevent downtime during deployment?
What happens to in-flight requests during rollout?

Resource Management
What are resource requests vs limits?
What happens if Java app exceeds memory limit?
What is OOMKilled?

Failure Scenarios
Node crashes — what happens to your app?
Pod restarts — what happens to cache/session?
How does Kubernetes self-heal?

🔴 Level 4 — Senior+ / Lead Level (Many Companies Ask)
Production Design
How would you design Spring Boot microservices in Kubernetes?
How would you design Kafka consumers in Kubernetes?
How would you design DB connections inside Kubernetes?

Real Scenario
Your Java app works locally but fails in Kubernetes. Debug steps?
Expected Flow:
Check logs
Check env variables
Check config mount
Check service connectivity
Check resource limits
Check readiness probe
