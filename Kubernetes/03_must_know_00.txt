👉 Expected Concepts: ConfigMap, Secret, env variables, volume mount configs

Health Checks (Very Important for Java)
6. What's the difference between: Liveness probe, Readiness probe, Startup probe?
7. How would you map Spring Boot Actuator endpoints to probes?

13. How do you tune JVM for containers?
👉 Expected:
Heap sizing vs container memory limit
GC tuning
Startup time impact

Stateless Design (Very Common Question)

Real Scenario
Your Java app works locally but fails in Kubernetes. Debug steps?
Expected Flow:
Check logs
Check env variables
Check config mount
Check service connectivity
Check resource limits
Check readiness probe
