Microservices – 50 Scenario-Based Interview Questions
Service design & boundaries

You’re breaking a monolith into microservices. How do you decide service boundaries?

Two services share the same database tables. What problems will this cause and how do you fix it?

A service grows too large and becomes a “mini-monolith.” What refactoring steps do you take?

How do you identify whether a service is too chatty?

When do you merge services instead of splitting them further?

Data ownership & consistency

Each service owns its database. How do you implement cross-service queries?

How do you handle eventual consistency in user-facing flows?

A transaction spans multiple services. How do you ensure consistency without 2PC?

How do you design idempotent APIs in distributed systems?

How do you deal with duplicate requests caused by retries?

Communication patterns

When do you use sync (REST/gRPC) vs async (events) communication?

How do you avoid cascading failures in synchronous calls?

A downstream service is slow but not failing. How do you protect upstream services?

How do you version APIs without breaking consumers?

How do you evolve an API that is used by many teams?

Reliability & resilience

One service failure brings down multiple services. What design mistake was made?

How do you design timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers correctly?

What is the risk of aggressive retries and how do you mitigate it?

How do you design graceful degradation in microservices?

What does a good health check look like in microservices?

Observability & debugging

A request flows through multiple services and fails intermittently. How do you debug it?

How do you design distributed tracing?

Logs show success but users see failures. What could be wrong?

How do you correlate logs across services?

How do you monitor SLA/SLOs across multiple services?

Security & access control

How do you handle authentication and authorization across microservices?

How do you secure service-to-service communication?

One service is compromised. How do you limit blast radius?

How do you manage secrets without hard-coding them?

How do you prevent data leakage between services?

Deployment & versioning

How do you deploy microservices with zero downtime?

A new version of a service breaks older consumers. How do you fix and prevent this?

How do you handle database schema changes in live systems?

How do you safely roll back a failed deployment?

How do you deploy changes independently without coordination hell?

Scaling & performance

One service needs to scale rapidly while others don’t. How do you handle this?

How do you handle hot spots caused by uneven traffic?

Where do you apply caching in microservices and why?

How do you avoid over-scaling due to noisy neighbors?

How do you design for predictable latency under load?

Governance & team practices

How do you enforce contract discipline between teams?

How do you prevent tight coupling between microservices?

How do you handle shared libraries without creating version lock-in?

How do you measure whether microservices are actually successful?

When does microservices architecture become a liability?

Architecture judgment

When would you choose a modular monolith instead of microservices?

What signals tell you your microservices architecture is over-engineered?

How do you decide what belongs in an API gateway vs a service?

How do you design systems for failure as a normal state?

What architectural trade-off are you most careful about in microservices?
