1. What is VPC in AWS?
    A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is your own isolated virtual network inside AWS where you launch and 
    control resources like EC2, EKS, and RDS.
    In a VPC, you decide:
        IP address range (CIDR)
        Public and private subnets
        Routing (internet gateway, NAT)
        Security (security groups, NACLs)

    Think of it as your private data center network, but running in AWS.

    Key components
    Subnets → divide the network (public / private)
    Route tables → control traffic flow
    Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway → internet access
    Security Groups & NACLs → network security

    “A VPC is an isolated virtual network in AWS where you define IP ranges, subnets, routing, 
    and security for your cloud resources.”


2. What is AWS VPC CNI plugin?
    The AWS VPC CNI plugin is the networking component used by Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service that 
    assigns real VPC IP addresses to pods.
    What it does
        Attaches ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) to worker nodes
        Allocates secondary IPs from the VPC subnet
        Assigns one VPC IP per pod
        So every pod becomes directly reachable inside the VPC, without overlays or tunnels.
    he AWS VPC CNI plugin assigns VPC subnet IPs directly to EKS pods using ENIs, enabling
     native VPC networking without overlays.

3. How VPC and VPC CNI are connected?
    A VPC provides the network: IP address ranges, subnets, routing, and security rules.
    The AWS VPC CNI plugin is the bridge that connects Kubernetes pods to that VPC network.

    When a pod is created in EKS, the VPC CNI:
        Takes an IP address from the VPC subnet
        Assigns it to the pod via an ENI attached to the node
        Makes the pod directly routable inside the VPC

    Because of this:
    Pods live inside the VPC, not on a separate overlay network
    VPC routing tables, security groups, and NACLs apply to pod traffic
    Pods can directly access AWS services like RDS and ALB

    Simple mental model (interview-friendly)
    VPC → the road network
    VPC CNI → assigns house numbers (IP addresses) to pods on that road

    One-line interview answer
    “VPC provides the network, and the AWS VPC CNI plugin assigns VPC subnet IPs to EKS 
    pods so they participate directly in that network.”
