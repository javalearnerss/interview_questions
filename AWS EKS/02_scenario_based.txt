🔥 Cluster Creation & Architecture Scenarios

Your EKS cluster creation succeeds, but no pods can be scheduled. What do you check first?

A team wants a public EKS cluster for speed. Security objects. How do you respond and redesign?

Your EKS control plane is healthy, but kubectl intermittently fails. How do you debug this?

A cluster works in one AWS account but not another with the same Terraform code. Why?

You’re asked to run prod and non-prod workloads in the same cluster. What could go wrong?

🌐 Networking & VPC Scenarios

Pods cannot reach an RDS instance in the same VPC. Where do you look?

External traffic reaches the ALB but never reaches pods. How do you debug?

Pods cannot reach the internet, but nodes can. What’s the likely cause?

Suddenly, new pods fail to start with no clear error. Later you find subnets are exhausted. How did this happen?

Inter-pod communication fails across nodes but works on the same node. Why?

🖥️ Worker Node & Node Group Scenarios

A node goes NotReady randomly and recovers on its own. What do you suspect?

After upgrading node AMIs, applications start failing intermittently. Why?

Cluster Autoscaler keeps adding nodes, but pods still don’t schedule. What’s wrong?

A node group upgrade causes partial outage. What was missed?

Pods are unevenly distributed across nodes causing hot spots. How do you fix it?

🔐 IAM, IRSA & Access Scenarios

Pods suddenly lose access to S3 even though IAM roles weren’t changed. Why?

A pod works with node IAM role but fails after enabling IRSA. What went wrong?

Developers ask for admin access to the cluster for debugging. How do you handle this safely?

One service can access AWS resources it shouldn’t. How do you audit and fix it?

A new engineer cannot access the cluster despite IAM permissions. What did you forget?

🚀 Deployments & Workload Scenarios

Pods keep restarting with CrashLoopBackOff but logs look fine. What do you check next?

Rolling deployment causes user-visible downtime. Why?

A deployment works in staging but fails in production only under load. Why?

Pods remain in Pending state forever. What are the top 5 things you check?

One bad pod affects the entire node’s performance. How do you prevent this?

⚖️ Autoscaling & Performance Scenarios

HPA scales pods aggressively but performance degrades. Why?

Cluster Autoscaler keeps scaling nodes up and down every few minutes. What’s wrong?

Kafka consumers scale up but throughput doesn’t improve. Why?

CPU is low, memory is high, but HPA doesn’t scale. What did you miss?

Autoscaling works in test but not in prod. Why?

🌍 Load Balancing & Ingress Scenarios

ALB is created but shows all targets as unhealthy. How do you debug?

One path works on ALB, another returns 404 even though service exists. Why?

Internal services are accidentally exposed publicly. How did this happen?

TLS works for one domain but not another on the same ALB. Why?

Traffic spikes cause ALB 5xx errors during deployments. How do you fix it?

💾 Storage & Stateful Workloads

Pods using PVCs get stuck during rescheduling. Why?

After node failure, stateful pods don’t recover. What went wrong?

Application performance drops after moving from EC2 disks to EBS. Why?

Multiple pods try to mount the same EBS volume and fail. Why?

A StatefulSet loses data after restart. How is that possible?

🔍 Observability & Debugging Scenarios

Pods restart but no logs are available. How do you debug?

Metrics show everything is healthy, but users report outages. Why?

DNS resolution fails intermittently inside the cluster. What causes this?

Liveness probe keeps killing healthy pods. Why?

You cannot reproduce a prod issue locally. How do you debug it in EKS?

🔄 Upgrade & Maintenance Scenarios

EKS control plane upgrade succeeds, but workloads break. Why?

Deprecated APIs cause failures after upgrade. How do you avoid this?

Node upgrades trigger Kafka rebalances and downtime. How do you prevent it?

During maintenance, pods are evicted too aggressively. What was missing?

How do you design zero-downtime cluster upgrades?

🔥 Security & Incident Scenarios

A pod is compromised. How do you contain blast radius?

A container image vulnerability is reported in production. What do you do immediately?

A service account has cluster-admin accidentally. How do you detect this?

Secrets were leaked via logs. How do you prevent this permanently?

Compliance asks for namespace isolation guarantees. How do you design it?

🧠 Senior / Architect-Level Scenarios

One giant EKS cluster vs multiple clusters — production outage occurs. What do you change?

A “noisy neighbor” workload affects critical services. How do you isolate?

Teams deploy whatever they want, causing chaos. How do you enforce standards?

DR region has EKS cluster but traffic switch fails. Why?

If you were to redesign your EKS platform today, what would you do differently?
