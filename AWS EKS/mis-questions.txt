1. What is VPC in AWS?
    A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is your own isolated virtual network inside AWS where you launch and 
    control resources like EC2, EKS, and RDS.
    In a VPC, you decide:
    IP address range (CIDR)
    Public and private subnets
    Routing (internet gateway, NAT)
    Security (security groups, NACLs)

    Think of it as your private data center network, but running in AWS.

    Key components
    Subnets → divide the network (public / private)
    Route tables → control traffic flow
    Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway → internet access
    Security Groups & NACLs → network security

    and security for your cloud resources.”
