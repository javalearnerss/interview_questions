1. Angular Fundamentals
Core Concepts

What is Angular and how is it different from AngularJS?

Explain Angular architecture (Modules, Components, Services, etc.).

What is TypeScript and why Angular uses it?

What is Ahead-of-Time (AOT) vs Just-in-Time (JIT)?

What is Ivy renderer?

Components

What is a component lifecycle?

Difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

When do you use ngOnChanges?

What causes ngDoCheck to run?

When would you use OnPush change detection?

🧠 2. Data Binding & Templates

Explain interpolation vs property binding vs event binding.

What is two-way binding and how does it work internally?

Difference between attribute binding and property binding?

What is template reference variable?

What is structural directive vs attribute directive?

👉 Scenario:

If template is slow, how will you optimize it?

📦 3. Modules & Dependency Injection

What is NgModule?

What is lazy loading?

What is hierarchical DI?

Difference between providers in root vs module vs component?

Difference between useClass, useValue, useFactory, useExisting?

👉 Advanced:

How Angular resolves dependencies at runtime?

What happens if two providers provide same token?

🔁 4. Change Detection

How change detection works internally?

Zone.js role in Angular?

Default vs OnPush strategy?

When change detection does NOT run?

👉 Scenario:

App is slow with large list → how to optimize?

Expected answers:

trackBy

OnPush

Virtual scrolling

detach change detector

🌐 5. Routing

What is RouterModule.forRoot vs forChild?

What are route guards?

Difference between CanActivate vs CanLoad?

What is Resolver?

👉 Scenario:

How do you preload lazy modules?

🔐 6. Security

What is XSS and how Angular prevents it?

What is DomSanitizer?

What is Content Security Policy?

👉 Scenario:

Backend returns HTML → how safely render?

📡 7. HTTP & API Communication

How HttpClient works?

What is interceptor?

How to handle global errors?

👉 Scenario:

Add auth token to every request?

Retry failed requests automatically?

🧮 8. RxJS (Very Important for Experienced)
Core

What is Observable?

Observable vs Promise?

Hot vs Cold Observables?

Subject vs BehaviorSubject vs ReplaySubject?

Operators

switchMap vs mergeMap vs concatMap vs exhaustMap?

debounceTime vs throttleTime?

shareReplay use case?

👉 Scenario:

Cancel previous API call on new search input?

🏗 9. State Management

What is state management?

When do you need NgRx?

What is Store, Action, Reducer, Effect?

👉 Scenario:

Multiple components need same data → best approach?

⚡ 10. Performance Optimization

Lazy loading

Preloading strategies

Tree shaking

Bundle optimization

trackBy

OnPush

Memoization

👉 Scenario:

App bundle is 10MB → how to reduce?

🧪 11. Testing

Jasmine vs Karma?

What is TestBed?

What is mocking?

Component vs service testing?

👉 Scenario:

How do you test HTTP calls?

🏛 12. Architecture & Design (Senior Level)

Smart vs Dumb components?

Facade pattern?

Core vs Shared module?

Microfrontend with Angular?

👉 Scenario:

Large enterprise Angular app → folder structure?

🎯 13. Real Company-Level Questions

These are asked in product companies:

How Angular compiles templates internally?

How DI tree is created?

How change detection tree works?

How Angular bootstraps application?

How Angular handles zones + async tasks?

🧨 14. Hard Angular Questions (Where Candidates Fail)

Why subscribe inside subscribe is bad?

Why not use async pipe everywhere?

When NOT to use NgRx?

Why OnPush sometimes doesn’t update UI?

Memory leak scenarios in Angular?
