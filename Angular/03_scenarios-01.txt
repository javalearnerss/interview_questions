1. Change Detection & Performance
Scenario 1

Your Angular app becomes slow after loading a dashboard with 1000+ rows.

Questions

How does Angular change detection work?

How do you identify unnecessary change detection cycles?

When would you use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush?

How do trackBy and immutable data structures help?

Expected Discussion

Default vs OnPush

ngFor trackBy

Avoiding function calls in templates

Using async pipe

Scenario 2

A child component updates data, but the parent UI doesn’t refresh.

Questions

Why might the UI not update?

How do @Input() references affect OnPush?

How do you manually trigger change detection?

Key Concepts

Reference vs mutation

ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()

detectChanges()

🔹 2. Component Communication
Scenario 3

You need to communicate between two unrelated components (no parent-child relation).

Questions

What are your options?

When would you avoid @Input/@Output?

How would you implement this using RxJS?

Expected Solutions

Shared service with Subject / BehaviorSubject

State management (NgRx)

Signals (Angular 16+)

Scenario 4

Multiple components need the same API data, but API calls are duplicated.

Questions

How do you prevent duplicate API calls?

Where do you cache the data?

How do you handle refresh logic?

Expected Answer

Service-level caching

shareReplay(1)

Centralized data store

🔹 3. RxJS & Async Programming
Scenario 5

A user types in a search box; API is called on every keystroke.

Questions

How do you optimize this?

Which RxJS operators do you use?

How do you cancel in-flight requests?

Expected Operators

debounceTime

distinctUntilChanged

switchMap

takeUntil

Scenario 6

Multiple API calls are needed before showing a page.

Questions

When do you use forkJoin, combineLatest, or zip?

What happens if one API fails?

Expected Knowledge

Error handling with catchError

Parallel vs sequential calls

🔹 4. Routing & Lazy Loading
Scenario 7

Your Angular app’s initial load is very slow.

Questions

How do you reduce bundle size?

How does lazy loading work internally?

How do you detect unused modules?

Expected Discussion

Lazy-loaded feature modules

Standalone components

Route-level code splitting

Scenario 8

User directly opens a protected route via URL.

Questions

How do you prevent unauthorized access?

Difference between CanActivate, CanLoad, and CanMatch?

Expected Answer

Route guards

Preloading strategies

Auth state handling

🔹 5. Forms (Reactive Focus)
Scenario 9

You need dynamic forms (add/remove fields at runtime).

Questions

How do you design this using Reactive Forms?

How do you validate dynamically added controls?

Expected Concepts

FormArray

Custom validators

Cross-field validation

Scenario 10

Form validation errors appear before user interaction.

Questions

How do you control validation display?

What is touched, dirty, pristine?

🔹 6. State Management (NgRx / Signals)
Scenario 11

App state becomes inconsistent across components.

Questions

When do you introduce NgRx?

What problems does it solve?

How do actions, reducers, and effects work together?

Expected Discussion

Unidirectional data flow

Side effects with Effects

Store vs local state

Scenario 12

You migrate from NgRx to Signals.

Questions

Why would you prefer Signals?

How do Signals differ from Observables?

Where would you still use RxJS?

🔹 7. Error Handling & Debugging
Scenario 13

Production errors are hard to reproduce.

Questions

How do you implement global error handling?

How do you capture errors centrally?

Expected Tools

ErrorHandler

HTTP interceptors

Logging services (Sentry, Datadog)

Scenario 14

One API fails but the UI should still partially render.

Questions

How do you design graceful degradation?

How do you isolate failures?

🔹 8. Security
Scenario 15

Sensitive data appears in browser dev tools.

Questions

What should never be stored on frontend?

How do you secure tokens?

XSS prevention strategies?

Expected Answers

Avoid localStorage for JWT

HTTP-only cookies

Angular sanitization

🔹 9. Build, Deployment & Environment
Scenario 16

Different configs are needed for dev, QA, and prod.

Questions

How does Angular environment configuration work?

How do you prevent secrets leakage?

Scenario 17

After deployment, users see a blank screen.

Questions

How do you debug production builds?

How do you handle version mismatches and cache issues?

🔹 10. Architecture & Best Practices
Scenario 18

Your Angular app grows to 50+ modules.

Questions

How do you structure the project?

How do you enforce boundaries?

How do you avoid cyclic dependencies?

Scenario 19

UI logic starts creeping into services.

Questions

What belongs in a component vs service?

How do you keep components thin?

🔹 11. Testing Scenarios
Scenario 20

A critical bug escaped to production.

Questions

What type of test would have caught it?

Unit vs integration vs e2e?

How do you mock HTTP and services?
