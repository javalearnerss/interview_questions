You render 10,000 rows using *ngFor.

👉 Questions:

Why UI freezes?

How will trackBy help?

Would virtual scrolling help?

Would OnPush alone fix it?

✅ Scenario 3 — UI Not Updating with OnPush

Component uses OnPush but UI doesn’t refresh when object property changes.

👉 Questions:

Why?

How Angular checks reference vs value?

How will you fix?

🌐 4. Routing & Navigation
✅ Scenario 9 — Secure Lazy Module

Admin module must:

Load only if user is admin

Not be downloaded otherwise

Which is safer?

How to prevent preloading?

✅ Scenario 10 — Preloading Strategy

App has 15 lazy modules but user navigates only 3 mostly.

👉 Questions:

Would you preload all?

Would you create custom preloader?

How measure improvement?

🔐 5. Security Real Scenarios
✅ Scenario 11 — Rendering Backend HTML

Backend sends formatted HTML content.

Sometimes API is called twice.

👉 Questions:

Multiple subscriptions?

shareReplay misuse?

Multiple interceptors?

📦 8. Build & Deployment Scenarios
✅ Scenario 17 — Bundle Size Too Large

Bundle = 12MB

👉 Questions:

What will you check first?

How to find heavy dependency?

Would lazy loading solve everything?

🧠 9. Enterprise Architecture Scenarios
✅ Scenario 18 — Reusable Component Library

You must build internal UI library.

👉 Questions:

How structure modules?

How version components?

How avoid breaking apps?

✅ Scenario 19 — Microfrontend Integration
