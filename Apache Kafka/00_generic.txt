Kafka Fundamentals (Experienced-Level)

    1. Why did your organization choose Kafka over traditional messaging systems?
    2. What problems does Kafka solve well—and what does it not solve?
    3. How does Kafka guarantee message ordering?
    4. What is the role of partitions in Kafka scalability?
    5. How do producers decide which partition a message goes to?
    6. What happens if a partition leader fails?
    7. How does Kafka ensure durability?
    8. What are ISR (In-Sync Replicas)?
    9. What happens when ISR shrinks?
    10. How does Kafka handle backpressure?


Error Handling & Reliability

    How do you pause and resume consumption safely?

Performance & Tuning
    What metrics matter most for Kafka performance?
    How do you tune consumers for low latency?
    How does compression affect performance?
    What causes throughput to drop suddenly?

Kafka in Distributed Systems
    How do you design event-driven systems with Kafka?
    Kafka vs REST — when to use which?
    How do you guarantee ordering across services?

Failure & Resilience Thinking

✅ How do you design failure isolation?
✅ How do you prevent cascading failures via Kafka?

Tier 3 — Nice to Know (Good for Senior / Lead Interviews)

You don’t need deep mastery, just conceptual clarity:

• What happens if partition leader fails?
• What are ISR and why do they matter?
• How does Kafka handle backpressure?
• How do you detect stuck partitions?
