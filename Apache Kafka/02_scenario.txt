🔥 Kafka Consumer Scenarios

Consumer lag keeps increasing but CPU and memory look normal. How do you debug this?

After a deployment, consumers stop processing messages but offsets keep committing. What went wrong?

Kafka consumers restart frequently during peak traffic. Why?

One consumer instance is much slower than others in the same group. How do you investigate?

Consumers process messages twice after a restart. Is this expected? How do you prevent it?

A consumer crashes on a specific message and keeps reprocessing it forever. What do you do?

Rebalancing happens too frequently and throughput collapses. What causes this?

Consumers fall behind only at night. What could explain this?

One partition is always lagging while others are fine. Why?

After scaling consumers, throughput doesn’t improve. Why?

🚀 Kafka Producer Scenarios

Producer logs show “message sent successfully” but consumers don’t receive anything. How do you debug?

Producer latency spikes suddenly with no code change. What could cause this?

Messages are duplicated after enabling retries. Why?

Producers start timing out intermittently under load. What do you tune?

A producer crash causes message loss. How is that possible?

Large messages cause producer OOM errors. How do you fix it?

Producer throughput drops after enabling compression. Why?

Messages are unevenly distributed across partitions. What’s wrong?

One producer floods Kafka and impacts all other services. How do you isolate it?

Producer sends data faster than consumers can handle. How do you handle backpressure?

⚖️ Offset & Delivery Semantics Scenarios

Offsets are committed but database records are missing. How did this happen?

You need exactly-once processing but still see duplicates. Why?

Business asks to replay last 3 days of data without breaking systems. How do you do it?

A consumer accidentally resets offsets to earliest in production. What do you do next?

Duplicate messages corrupt downstream systems. How do you redesign?

Offset commits fail intermittently. What are the consequences?

How do you safely pause consumption during incidents?

A rollback requires reprocessing messages already consumed. How do you handle it?

Messages arrive out of order. Why?

Consumers reprocess messages after scaling down. Is this expected?

🧱 Topic & Partition Design Scenarios

Topic was created with too few partitions and now can’t keep up. What are your options?

One partition becomes a hotspot. How do you fix it without downtime?

Increasing partitions breaks message ordering. Why?

Too many topics exist and Kafka becomes hard to manage. How do you fix governance?

A topic grows faster than expected and disk fills up. What do you do?

Retention cleanup causes performance degradation. Why?

Compacted topic loses data unexpectedly. How?

Partition reassignment causes lag spikes. Why?

Multi-tenant topics cause noisy-neighbor issues. How do you isolate?

What happens if partition leaders move frequently?

🧬 Schema & Data Evolution Scenarios

Producer deploys a schema change and consumers crash. What went wrong?

Old consumers break after a new field is added. Why?

Schema Registry is down — what happens?

Different teams evolve schemas independently. How do you prevent outages?

A backward-compatible change still causes issues. Why?

How do you safely remove a field from events?

A schema change corrupts downstream data. How do you recover?

Schema compatibility rules are bypassed in production. What’s the impact?

Replay of old events fails due to schema mismatch. Why?

How do you test schema changes before production?

🧨 Failure & Reliability Scenarios

Kafka broker goes down during peak traffic. What happens?

ISR shrinks frequently. What does that indicate?

Disk usage grows faster than expected. Why?

Network latency spikes affect Kafka cluster. What breaks first?

One broker is much slower than others. Why?

Zookeeper instability causes Kafka issues. How?

Kafka cluster survives but clients start failing. Why?

GC pauses on brokers cause lag. How do you detect?

Messages pile up but brokers look healthy. What do you check?

What failure modes can cause silent data loss?

⚙️ Performance & Tuning Scenarios

Throughput suddenly drops by 50% after a config change. How do you debug?

Consumer fetch requests are slow. Why?

High CPU on brokers but low network usage. Why?

Compression improves throughput but increases latency. Why?

Kafka performs well in test but poorly in prod. Why?

Increasing batch size makes latency worse. Why?

Brokers run out of file handles. What caused it?

GC tuning improves throughput but causes latency spikes. Why?

How do you identify the true bottleneck — producer, broker, or consumer?

What tuning mistakes commonly cause outages?

🌍 Kafka in Distributed Systems Scenarios

A service publishes events but downstream state is inconsistent. Why?

Kafka is used as a request-response system and starts failing. Why?

A single event triggers a cascade of failures. How do you prevent this?

Event-driven workflow partially completes and gets stuck. Why?

Multiple services consume the same topic but interpret data differently. How do you fix this?

Replay causes downstream systems to double charge customers. What went wrong?

Event ordering across services is broken. Why?

Kafka becomes a shared blast radius. How do you redesign?

One bad consumer slows the entire ecosystem. How?

What Kafka anti-patterns have you seen in microservices?

🔐 Security & Compliance Scenarios

Unauthorized consumer reads sensitive data. How did this happen?

ACL misconfiguration blocks production traffic. How do you recover?

Certificates expire and Kafka clients start failing. What breaks?

A team bypasses security using shared credentials. How do you prevent this?

Audit team asks who accessed which topics. How do you answer?

Kafka credentials leak. What’s your immediate action?

TLS handshake failures happen intermittently. Why?

IAM-based auth works in one region but not another. Why?

Security changes break older consumers. Why?

How do you rotate secrets without downtime?

🧠 Senior / Architect-Level Scenarios

Kafka is used everywhere and becomes hard to govern. What do you change?

Business wants Kafka for everything. When do you say no?

Kafka cluster cost keeps increasing. How do you optimize?

One team’s design causes repeated Kafka incidents. How do you fix culturally and technically?
